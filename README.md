# BBOpt

_The easiest hyperparameter optimization you'll ever do._

BBopt is a frontend for easily interfacing with any black box optimization framework.

BBopt provides a universal interface based on the standard library `random` module (so you don't even have to learn anything new!) that lets you define your tunable parameters.

Once you've defined your parameters, training a black box optimization model on those parameters is as simple as `python your_file.py`, and serving your file with optimized parameters is as simple as `import your_file`.

## Installation

Installing BBopt is as easy as
```
pip install bbopt
```

## Usage

To use bbopt, just add
```python
# BBopt boilerplate:
from bbopt import BlackBoxOptimizer
bb = BlackBoxOptimizer(file=__file__)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    bb.run(backend="scikit-optimize")
```
to the top of your file, then call
```python
x = bb.param(name="x", uniform=(0, 1))
```
for each of the tunable parameters in your model, and finally add
```python
bb.maximize(y)      or      bb.minimize(y)
```
to set the value being optimized. Then, run
```
python <your file here>
```
to train your model, and just
```
import <your module here>
```
to serve it.

## Backends

Currently, bbopt only supports the `scikit-optimize` and `random` backends, but more are in the works! To change backends, just modify `backend="scikit-optimize"` in the boilerplate to whatever backend you want to use. All backends always use the universal interface of
```python
bb.param(name=<name>, <stdlib random function>=<args to function>)
```
to define parameters.
